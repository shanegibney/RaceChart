# D3 v4 Race Chart

Running on [gh-pages](https://shanegibney.github.io/RaceChart/)

# To do:

* Add Izanuk's zoom and pan to main chart
  * difficulty with scaleBand(), may need to completely build feature from scratch for smooth zooming and panning.
* Add [Update Pattern](https://github.com/shanegibney/D3-v4-Bar-Chart-Update-Pattern) and Bootstrap nav bar to enable users to switch between different race JSON files.
* Improve UI of sort buttons
* Make bars center on ticks regardless of number objects in data
* Filter main bar chart and table by clicking on pie chart segments and clubs bar chart. This will involve filter original data and then implementing update pattern.
